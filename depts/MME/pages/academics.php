            The science and technology of metals and alloys are primarily the
            domain of metallurgical engineering. Materials science and
            engineering is the interdisciplinary field that discovers, studies
            and designs new materials for making engineering structures and
            devices. It combines chemistry, physics, and engineering to solve
            problems that would benefit our society in manufacturing, energy,
            sustainability, environmental protection, transport, electronics,
            healthcare, and many others.<br /><br />
            The Department of Metallurgical & Materials Engineering is one of
            the oldest departments of IIT Madras, established in the same year
            as the Institute (1959). In the first few decades of its existence,
            then known as the Department of Metallurgy, it focused more on
            industrial metallurgy and contributed immensely to metal casting,
            forming, and welding. Over the past few decades, academic and
            research interest in non-metallic materials has grown globally. In
            tune with this change, the Department changed its name to the
            Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering to adapt to
            the transformations and expectations worldwide. The Department
            currently has a wide range of expertise in many areas of metallurgy
            and materials science & engineering.
