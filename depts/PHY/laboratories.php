        I am very pleased to welcome you to the website of the Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati (IITT), an up-and-coming autonomous institution established in 2015 under the Ministry of Education, Government of India. As one of the nine Departments of IITT, we have been making efforts to advance the educational experiences for our students with an emphasis on research-based learning to train them with cutting-edge technologies and skills mainly to enable them to grow as global leaders in science, engineering, and technology. The vision of CEE is to achieve excellence in pedagogy and research relevant to the natural environment as well as sustainable and resilient infrastructure, with a focus on quality-of-life initiatives of national and international importance. That being said, the visions will be accomplished by nurturing our engineers and scientists of the future through: (a) quality education and training; (b) state-of-the-art research; (c) offering technical expertise to academia, industry, and society; and (d) various outreach activities. In pursuit of the vision, CEE aims to create manpower with high-quality technical knowhow and competence. Further, the CEE envisions to synergize research activities in the areas of sustainable and smart infrastructure, climate studies, remote sensing, environment, and health. In a nutshell, the following are the thrust areas of CEE at IITT:<br /></span></span> <br />
